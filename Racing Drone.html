<h2> <abbr aria-label="first person view">FPV</abbr> flying means that pilots only see what the drone sees.</h2>

<P>This is accomplished by <strong>live streaming footage</strong> from a camera mounted on the nose of the drone. The image is transmitted via radio waves to goggles worn by the pilot. 
The <strong>remote control, drone, and goggles </strong> are all connected via radio and must transmit with sufficient speed and reliability to allow effective control. 
This technology is very new and is constantly being improved. <em>FPV</em> goggles on the market range from $100 to $500, with the more <a href="http://droneinsider.org/top-5-best-fpv-goggles-2016/">expensive goggles</a> offering more and better features. 
Some of these features include a wide field of view (FOV), head tracking, and multiple frequency settings.</p>

<p>While the pilot always requires goggles, some drone racing organizations insist they should also be used among spectators alike.
Any drone could be used to race, however competitive FPV racing leagues require drones to meet certain standards. The Drone Racing League (DRL) makes all of the drones used in its events in house; pilots are supplied with drones, backup drones, and parts by the league itself, not independently.
In contrast MultiGP, defines community produced specifications and allows participants to supply their own drones increasing competitiveness and innovation.[4] For competition, aircraft are typically separated into classes, separating winged craft from rotorcraft; and also categorising by size and power.

<hr>Racing drones are designed to focus all of their energy into moving forward, as opposed to a photography/video drone which is focused more on hovering. A photography quadcopter design will typically have four blades configured in an X-pattern, all equally spaced apart. 
A racing model will typically have its four blades configured in an H-pattern configured to thrust the drone forward, not up. 
Because of their light weight and electric motors with large amounts of torque, drones can accelerate and maneuver with great speed and agility. 
This makes for very sensitive controls and requires a pilot with quick reaction times and a steady hand.</hr>

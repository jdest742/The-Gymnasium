<h1>Drone Racing & FPV Flying</h2>

<Blockquote main>
<div style="width:70%"><p> <abbr aria-label="first person view">FPV</abbr> flying means that pilots only see what the drone sees.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by <strong>live streaming footage</strong> from a camera mounted on the nose of the drone. The image is transmitted via radio waves to goggles worn by the pilot. </p>

<div style="width:70%"><p>The <strong>remote control, drone, and goggles </strong> are all connected via radio and must transmit with sufficient speed and reliability to allow effective control. 
This technology is very new and is constantly being improved. <em>FPV</em> goggles on the market range from $100 to $500, with the more <a href="http://droneinsider.org/top-5-best-fpv-goggles-2016/">expensive goggles</a> offering more and better features. 
Some of these features include a wide field of view (FOV), head tracking, and multiple frequency settings.</p></div>
